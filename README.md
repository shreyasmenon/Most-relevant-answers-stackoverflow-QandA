BIA 660 project

This project would suggest the best possible answer to the requested question by the user and would help users twofold first it would save the search timing and secondly offers the relevant answers to the problem.

Steps : 
1.Knowledge base
Web Scrapping -> Data cleansing & Structuring ->Comparison of Multilabel Classification model -> Best classification model for prediction  

2.User utility
User asks a question -> Classification model predicts the best possible labels -> Find the most relavant (similar) question from knowledge base (using cosine similarity) -> show top 3 most similar answers for the question.   

What inspired us to choose this topic?
1.SO.com has a large number of Q&A posted on their websites. We can currently access those free of cost. However, what if they make it paid? Let's develop our own Q&A repository.

2.What If companies wish to develop their own knowledge repository? Our classification algo can help them to find the most relavant answers to dev questions.

3.As a future scope, we can develop a chat bot where any user can ask questions (think conceptual questions like 'Use of pandas in python.') and receive answers in a quick and conversational manner.
